== Description ==
The UserLast plugin is used to show the date and time of the last login of users of your Wordpress site.
 
After installing and enabling the UserLast plugin, information about the last time when a user logged into the site will be displayed in two places:
 
*   In the new column "last login" on the list of all users in the administration panel. It is possible to sort the list by this paramter.
*   In the edit view of a specific user in the admin panel, in the "Last login" section.

Be aware, that the UserLast registers when each user has actually logged in (went through the process of providing their username and password to access the site). This may not reflect accurately their latest *activity* on the site.
